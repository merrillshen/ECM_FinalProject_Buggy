# Course project - Mine navigation search and rescue

## Challenge brief

Your task is to develop an autonomous robot that can navigate a "mine" using a series of instructions coded in coloured cards and return to its starting position.  Your robot must be able to perform the following: 

1. Navigate towards a coloured card and stop before impacting the card
1. Read the card colour
1. Interpret the card colour using a predefined code and perform the navigation instruction
1. When the final card is reached, navigate back to the starting position
1. Handle exceptions and return back to the starting position if final card cannot be found

## Project Description


## Guide to set up the buggy

1. Place buggy at the starting point in the respective "mine", when the buggy is ready for calibration, LED D7 turns on. A white card and black card is needed for the initial calibration. 
2. Place the white card directly infront of the light sensor and toggle button RF2. LED D7 will flash once to indicate that the white card has been calibrated.
3. Place the black card approximately 4cm away from the light sensor for calibration. This is to account for ambient lighting and reflectivity of the black card. Toggle button RF2 again to calibrate the black card. LED D7 will flash once again. Once the calibration process is complete, LED D7 turns off while LED H3 turns on. This means that the buggy is ready to start the colour sensing process.
4. To start the buggy, toggle button RF3.
